Analytics plugin.  The general idea is that we have a behavior reporter, and this behavior
reporter can have any number of plugins, for simple printing of behavior, google analytics, mparticle,

The plugin is going to follow a certain form of having methods, and the behavior reporter is
going to call them appropriately.   As a reference, use the printBehaviorPlugin.brs
